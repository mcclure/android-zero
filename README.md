## Zero.apk

This is an Android app that does nothing. Literally. If you open it, it closes. That is all it does. Prebuilt APKs signed by "Dryad Technology" are [available](releases/latest).

## Why?

I made this in hopes I could use it to solve [a problem I was having with my Lenovo tablet](https://mastodon.social/@mcc/113032239485815629). It did not work.

## Possible future improvements

- Change icon from gray to white?
- The first time you launch it, it fills the screen with white. Maybe it should fill the screen with something else, such as the light gray of the navbar. Maybe it should change its color depending on whether you are using "light" or "dark" mode.
- Faster startup (could possibly prevent the screen filling with white)?
- If you run it, it appears afterward in the Overview (the recent apps thing). I cannot figure out how to make it not do this (no, killing the process doesn't help).
- Why is it six megabytes

Is there something about this app's behavior or packaging (does anyone need a Google Play release) that if changed, would change this app from useless to useful for you? If so, please file an issue.
